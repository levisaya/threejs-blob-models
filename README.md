# Threejs/ AngularJS Binary Model Loading
This is a demo showing how to load up a raw vertex array in Three.js.

It uses Angular.js and angular-ui router to load the models on demand on the frontend.

The backend is implemented in Python using Tornado as the web server.
It generates the vertex arrays at runtime with some NumPy array magic.
